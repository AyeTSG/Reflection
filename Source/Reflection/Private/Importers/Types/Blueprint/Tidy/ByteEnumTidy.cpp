/* Two of an enum compared, which the script keeps as two bytes.
 *
 * A byte is a byte to the machine. The enum lives on the pin, and the call the compiler wrote takes
 * two plain bytes, so it comes back with the enum on the side something is wired into and a bare
 * number on the side nobody wired. The value shows as a number with no name on it, and picking
 * another one means knowing what the numbers stand for.
 *
 * The name cannot be written onto the call. A call grows its pins from the function it calls, and a
 * function taking a byte says byte: anything put on the pin that the signature does not agree with
 * is taken back the next time the node is built, which is every time the asset is loaded. The name
 * left on it afterwards is a name where a number belongs.
 *
 * The editor does not use a call for this at all. It has a node of its own whose inputs take
 * whatever they are wired to and whose enum is therefore its own to keep, and that node compiles
 * back down to the very call that was read. So the call is laid down as the node it was written as,
 * and it survives being built again because nothing about it disagrees with anything. */
