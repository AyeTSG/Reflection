/* A context asked for, and then asked what it is.
 *
 * A game that keeps its own per player state reaches it through one library call handed a class,
 * and the call is declared as giving back the base of them all. So whoever wrote it wrote one node,
 * and what the compiler wrote down is that node followed by a cast to the class they asked for.
 *
 * Read back statement by statement the cast comes with it, and the graph gains a pair of nodes
 * saying what one said. Worse, the pair is not what the editor offers: the node it gives has the
 * class on the node itself, so a graph rebuilt as a call and a cast cannot be edited into the shape
 * it came from.
 *
 * Which node depends on what was asked for. A class the game keeps as a subsystem is reached with
 * the engine own Get Subsystem; anything else is the game own Get Blueprint Context, and that one
 * refuses a class that is not one of its contexts. Handed the wrong one it clears what it was given
 * and says it has no class, which is worse than the call it replaced, so what it took is read back
 * before the call is thrown away.
 *
 * The one call may be read by several casts, since the value it gives is worth nothing until it is
 * cast and whoever wrote two of these wrote a node each. */
