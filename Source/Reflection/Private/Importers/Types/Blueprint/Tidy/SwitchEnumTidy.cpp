 * whether the value is not this one, go to that case where it is, and carry on asking where it is
 * not. The last question falling through is the default.
 *
 * Read back a question at a time, an enum of six cases comes out as six comparisons and six
 * branches stepping down the graph, where what was drawn is one node with a way out per entry. The
 * ladder only appears in this one shape, and every rung asks the same value, so it is put back.
 *
 * Two cases may leave by the same way out, which is a ladder whose rungs lead to the same place and
